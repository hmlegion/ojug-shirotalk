OJUG Talk about Apache Shiro Application Security Framework

This is an application to demonstrate Apache Shiro Security.  The frontend is a Single Page Application using AngularJS and the backend is a Java-based Restful Web Services (for the most part). The technologies used are the following:

For the Frontend UI:  
  1. AngularJS  
  2. Bootstrap  

For the Backend Application  
  1. Apache Shiro - Security Framework
  2. Jersey 2 - Restful Services
  3. Guice - Dependency Injection
  4. JPA 2 (Hibernate) - Object Relational Mapper
  5. Groovy - Because I like Groovy
